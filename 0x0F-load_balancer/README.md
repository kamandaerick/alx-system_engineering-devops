This project involve setting up a HAProxy Load balancer

Load balancing is a technique used in computing and networking to distribute incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers or resources. The primary goal of load balancing is to ensure optimal utilization of resources, prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck, and enhance the overall performance, availability, and reliability of a system or application.

HAProxy, which stands for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open-source software solution used for load balancing and proxying TCP and HTTP-based applications. It operates at the application layer of the OSI model (Layer 7) and provides advanced features for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.

Here's a basic overview of how HAProxy achieves load balancing:

Request Reception:

HAProxy listens for incoming requests from clients, such as web browsers or other applications.
Server Health Monitoring:

HAProxy continuously monitors the health and status of the backend servers in the server pool. It checks whether each server is responsive and capable of handling requests.
Load Balancing Algorithms:

HAProxy employs various load balancing algorithms to determine how to distribute incoming requests among the available servers. Common algorithms include round-robin, least connections, and source IP hashing.
Request Distribution:

Once a request is received, HAProxy uses the selected load balancing algorithm to determine which backend server should handle the request. It then forwards the request to the chosen server.
Response Aggregation:

After the backend server processes the request, HAProxy collects and aggregates the responses before sending them back to the client. This ensures a seamless experience for the end user, as they perceive the responses as originating from a single server.
Session Persistence:

HAProxy can also provide session persistence, which means that subsequent requests from a client are directed to the same backend server. This is crucial for applications that require maintaining state across multiple requests.
Failover and High Availability:

In addition to load balancing, HAProxy is designed to provide high availability by automatically detecting and redirecting traffic away from failed or unhealthy servers. This ensures that the system remains operational even if some servers experience issues.
Security and SSL Termination:

HAProxy can also enhance security by acting as a reverse proxy, handling SSL termination, and providing protection against common security threats.
